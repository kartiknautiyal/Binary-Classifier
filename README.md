It is a binary classifier which works on keras module in python

This script uses data from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dbcWabr3Xrr4JvuG0VxTiweGzHn-YYvW/view 
The Zip file consists of images of cars and planes. They have been separated into 2 folders of training and test. Further, they have been labeled as 'cars' and 'planes'.

Using this script I was able to achieve a validation accuracy of above 85% consistently after the 15th epoch.
